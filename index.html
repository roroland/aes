          An Everyday Story is a 3D horizontal Story-Driven Platform game. We will explore the memories of man through the point of view of three little trinkets that he holds dear, since they represent the bonds with his loved ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          The story is about an Italian-American man's life, going from his childhood ('70) until his old age (2020). He loses his father in combat when he's 7 years old; this will cause him to live all his life with the fear of being abandoned by his dear ones.</p>
          <p>Since very young he becomes interested in artisanship; therefore he travels to Italy to discover his roots and learn more about the craft. There he meets the woman he'll love forever: they soon marry and then have a son.
            <p>After a brief period of internship, he opens his own business: a small handmade toy shop. 
              With time passing by though, the marriage falls apart, escalating to an accident that burns down half of the house they live in. This results in his wife and son abandoning him to his loneliness
